Since URIs are at the very core of Web architecture, they provide a solid foundation for user-centric identity.<br/><br/>The first piece of the OpenID framework is authentication: how you prove ownership of a URI. Today, websites require usernames and passwords to login, which means that many people use the same password everywhere. With OpenID Authentication, your username is your URI, and your password (or other credentials) stays safely stored on your OpenID Provider.<br/><br/>For more information, please go to: <a href="http://openid.net/" class="snsHpSmallTextLink">http://openid.net/</a></span>
