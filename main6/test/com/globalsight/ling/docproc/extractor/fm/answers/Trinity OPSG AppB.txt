Instrument analog-out/event-in connections
Signal connections

Allows an external device to start data acquisition. 
Maximum 30[x21]V.
[x22]Switch 2 (Out)
Used to send time-based contact closure signals to external devices. 
Maximum 30[x23]V, 0.5[x24]A, 10[x25]W.
Switch 3 (Out)
Used to send time-based contact closure signals to external devices. 
Maximum 30[x26]V, 0.5[x27]A, 10[x28]W.

To avoid electrical shock, use the SVT-type power cord in the United States and HAR-type (or better) in Europe. 
For information regarding what cord to use in other countries, contact your local Waters distributor.
The roughing pump is heavy. 
To avoid injury, at least two people must lift the pump.
To avoid gas leaks, use the sharp knife to cut the PVC exhaust tubing squarely (that is, perpendicular to its horizontal axis).
To avoid distorting the drip tray or causing the drain cup to leak, restrain the drain cup when attaching or removing the waste line.
To confirm the integrity of the source exhaust system, the following leak test must be performed.
To avoid damage to the instrument, snoop (or its equivalent) leak detector liquid must be used only for the purpose described in the following step. 
It must not be used on any other part of the instrument.
Do not connect the instrument’s power supply cord until you complete the installation procedures in the previous sections.
To prevent leakage of biologically hazardous materials, ensure that the
drain line does not crimp or bend. 
A crimp or bend can impede flow to the waste container.
waste container is emptied before the lower end of the drain tube is covered by waste solvent.
To avoid electric shock, all electrical connections to the rear panel must be separated from hazardous voltages by double or reinforced insulation. 
Circuits of this type are classified as safety extra low voltage (SELV). 
Examples of circuits that are typically SELV include contact closure inputs and outputs for auto-samplers, and UV, RI, and fluorescence detector signal outputs for LC/MS systems. 
The electrical connections on the rear panel of this mass spectrometer are all SELV.
To avoid electric shock and damage to the instrument, do not apply more than
±30[x32]V d.c. to the Analog (Out) connection.
30[x33]V d.c. to the Stop Flow (Out), Inject Start (In), Switch 2 (Out), Switch 3 (Out), and Switch 4 (Out) connections.

The waste line and connection can be contaminated with biologically hazardous materials. 
Always wear chemical-resistant, powder-free gloves while performing this procedure.
To prevent condensation from draining backward and damaging the pump, the exhaust tubing must be installed with an exhaust trap bottle; the bottle must be positioned at or below the roughing pump exhaust port.
LC solvents and analytes can be carried in the nitrogen exhaust, which must be vented via the nitrogen exhaust trap bottle and laboratory exhaust system. 
The [x38]laboratory exhaust system must provide a minimum vacuum of 0.20 kPa (2[x39]mbar, 0.03[x40]psi) below atmospheric pressure (negative pressure).
The exhaust connections can be contaminated with biohazardous and/or toxic materials. 
Always wear chemical-resistant, powder-free gloves when performing this procedure.
To avoid the buildup of hazardous gases, do not place the nitrogen exhaust trap bottle in an enclosed cabinet.
The instrument requires two separate [x41]exhaust systems: one for nitrogen, the other for the roughing pump. 
Vent them to atmosphere through separate exhaust lines. 
Oil mist can seriously damage the instrument if the nitrogen exhaust line connects with the roughing pump exhaust line. 
Your warranty does not cover damage caused by routing exhaust lines incorrectly.

Connecting the workstation
Before connecting the [x87]workstation to the instrument, set up the workstation according to its accompanying instructions. 
Locate the workstation within 5[x88]meters (16[x89]feet) of the instrument.
Requirement
Shielded [x90]network cables must be used with the instrument to ensure compliance with FCC, and other, limits.
To connect the workstation
Connect the monitor to the PC.
Connect one end of the shielded network cable to the appropriate port on the rear panel of the instrument.
Connect the other end of the shielded network cable to the port labeled instrument LAN on the workstation rear panel.
To connect the instrument to the [x91]power source
Select the correct power cord for your location.
Connect the female end of the power cord to the power port on the rear panel of the instrument.
Connecting Ethernet cables
Requirement
Shielded Ethernet cables must be used with the instrument to ensure compliance with FCC, and other, limits.
[x92]To make Ethernet connections
Connect one end of one shielded Ethernet cable to the network switch, and then connect the other end to the Ethernet card on the preconfigured ACQUITY™ workstation.
Tip
On preconfigured systems, the Ethernet card is identified as the Instrument [x93]LAN card.

I/O signal connectors
Signal connections
Requirement
To meet the regulatory requirements of immunity from external electrical disturbances, you must install [x95]connection covers over the signal connectors.
[x96]To make signal connections
Reference the signal connection location from the silk-screened label for inject start or any other input/output connection you plan to use from Connector I or II on the rear panel of each instrument.
To make the signal connections, attach the positive and negative leads of the signal cable to the connector.
