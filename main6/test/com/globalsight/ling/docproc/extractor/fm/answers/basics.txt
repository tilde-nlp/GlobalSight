[x16]A[x17]bout BMC Remedy Alert
Alerts are generated when certain conditions take place, such as when a request has been submitted or when progress has been made in resolving a request. 
Alerts can come from an [x18] server or from a separate program like BMC Remedy Flashboards. 
Alerts can be handled in different ways, depending on how the administrator configures the system and how you have set your user preferences.
instantly informs you when you have received a new alert. 
You can open your list of alerts, in [x19] or in a browser, to manage the list and to open the source request (the request that generated the alert).
Sometimes the administrator informs users about events or conditions through email notifications. 
Although email notifications provide information about the source request, they are not stored in a list, and you cannot manage them through [x20] or the web.
If the administrator notifies you through alerts, you can customize the kind of alert you receive in [x21]. 
For example, you can choose a sound or a message box.

Preference s[x54]ervers
A preference server is a server on which user preferences are stored. 
The administrator can specify a preference server during installation of AR[x55]System. 
A preference server enables [x56]s[x57]ettings on your local machine to be accessible from any computer on which the[x58] AR[x59]System[x60] [x61]client i[x62]s installed.
If [x63]the a[x64]dministrator has specified a preference server for your system, you can select that server when you log in[x65].[x66] 
The preference settings from your local machine (as set in the Options dialog box) are stored in the [x67] User Preference form on your preference server[x68].
I’m 4. 
I’m 5. 
I’m 6.
T[x69]he preferences you set from the [x70]Options dialog box are store[x71]d
l[x72]ocally in an [x73]ar.ini[x74] file [x75]i[x76]f you did not log in to a preference server[x77],[x78] or
c[x79]entrally in the preference server[x80],[x81] [x82]i[x83]f you did log in to a preference server[x84].
If you [x85]do not want to l[x86]og in to a preference server, select (none) in the Preference Server field when you log in.

Option and default settings
Server list
Information and settings used by [x88] and
By default, the [x89]Home folder is set to a folder within the [x90]arsystem[x91] installation folder. 
Usually this is [x92]C:\Program Files\arsystem\Home[x93].
If more than one person will be logging in on the same computer, [x94]always s[x95]pecify an alternate Home folder for each user. 
This allows individual users to have their own options and configuration settings.
If you do not specify alternate Home folders and other users log in to
on your computer, your settings will be overwritten.
If the administrator has specified a preference server, your settings will be retained when you log in to any computer.
For more information about the names and locations of configuration and option files in the [x96] installation, see the [x97]Installation Guide[x98].

You can also change information for existing users, and delete users.
Adding [x107]u[x108]sers

If unregistered users are not allowed on the servers in the server list, they will not be able to log in[x114].
If unregistered users are allowed on the servers in the server list, [x115]the system s[x116]tarts with a “guest” set of capabilities. 
A guest user can retrieve public information in the system.
If more than one user runs [x117]the AR[x118]System client o[x119]n the same computer, specify different [x120]AR[x121]System Home folders f[x122]or each user[x123].
Note: On t[x124]he user’s [x125]computer, a u[x126]ser can change another user’s list of servers and [x127]Home[x128] folder, but not the password.
