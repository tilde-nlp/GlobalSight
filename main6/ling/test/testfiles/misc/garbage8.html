<P>Here, an inline element CODE is interupted by an INPUT box. The
closing CODE tag has been moved to the skeleton because the parsing
context has been set to skeletal (not extracting).  The problem looks
like a misbehaviour of the extractor: it seems to prefer skeletal
breaks in favor of text-introducing tags.  (To rephrase that: tags
that "definitely" belong to the skeleton force a switch to the
skeleton, whereas tags that belong in text do *not* force a switch to
text.)</P> 

<P>A better way to process the tags would use 2 passes: the first pass
creates an ElementList, the second pass triages tags into skeleton and
text, thereby having the freedom to treat some "skeletal" tags as
inline, and inline tags surrounding a text context as skeletal. </P>
