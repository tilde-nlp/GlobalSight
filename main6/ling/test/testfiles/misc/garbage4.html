<P>Authoring error. Somebody wasn't sure what the target of the link
should be, so he thought it's cool to just make it an attribute -
adding the "??" indicator...</P>

<P>As it stands, the html lexer is pretty strict about which
characters can appear in an element name or an attribute name. Adding
"?" would remedy this case.</P>
