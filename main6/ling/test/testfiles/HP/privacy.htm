        HP and its subsidiaries are committed to respecting your privacy. We've 
        structured our websites so that, in general, you can visit HP on the Web 
        without identifying yourself or revealing any personal information. Once 
        you choose to provide us personally identifiable information (any information 
        by which you can be identified), you can be assured that it will only 
        be used to support your customer relationship with HP. 
      <p>This statement regarding the privacy of the personally identifiable information 
        you provide online covers five main areas: Awareness, Choice, Accuracy 
        &amp; Access, Security, and Oversight.</p>
      <h3>Awareness</h3>
      <p>HP provides this Online Privacy Statement to make you aware of our privacy 
        policy and practices and of the choices you can make about the way your 
        information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we 
        make it available on our homepage and from the bottom of every HP.Com 
        webpage. </p>
      <h4>What we collect</h4>
      <p>On some HP web pages, you can order products, make requests, and register 
        to receive materials. The types of personal information collected at these 
        pages are name, contact and billing information, transaction, and credit 
        card information.</p>
      <p> In order to tailor our subsequent communications to you and continuously 
        improve our products and services, we may also ask you to voluntarily 
        provide us with information regarding your personal or professional interests, 
        demographics, experience with our products, and contact preferences. </p>
      <h4>How we use it</h4>
      <p>HP uses your information to better understand your needs and provide 
        you with better service. Specifically, we use your information to help 
        you complete a transaction, to communicate back to you, to update you 
        on service and benefits, and to personalize our web site for you. Credit 
        card numbers are used only for payment processing and are not retained 
        for other purposes.</p>
      <p> From time to time, we may also use your information to contact you for 
        market research or to provide you with marketing information we think 
        would be of particular interest. At a minimum, we will always give you 
        the opportunity to opt out of receiving such direct marketing or market 
        research contact. We will also follow local requirements, such as allowing 
        you to opt in before receiving unsolicited contact, where applicable. 
      </p>
      <p>Data collected online may also be combined with information you provide 
        when you register your ownership of HP products.</p>
      <h4>Who we share it with</h4>
      <p>HP will not sell, rent, or lease your personally identifiable information 
        to others. Unless we have your permission or are required by law, we will 
        only share the personal data you provide online with other HP entities 
        and/or business partners who are acting on our behalf to complete the 
        activities described above. Such HP entities and/or business partners, 
        including those located in other countries, are governed by our privacy 
        policies with respect to the use of this data.</p>
      <h3><b>Choice</b></h3>
      <p>HP will not use or share the personally identifiable information provided 
        to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without first 
        letting you know and offering you a choice<b>. </b>As previously stated, 
        we will also provide you the opportunity to let us know if you do not 
        wish to receive unsolicited direct marketing materials from us and we 
        will do everything we can to honor such requests<b>. </b></p>
      <p>Your permission is always secured first, should we ever share your information 
        with third parties that are not acting on our behalf and governed by our 
        privacy policy. For example, as part of HP’s commitment to offering you 
        choice, we enable you to make online purchases directly from us or through 
        our resellers. When you choose our resellers, we inform you that your 
        registration and shopping basket data is being transferred to the reseller 
        you selected. This notice is important because when you choose to have 
        your registration and shopping basket data transferred to the reseller, 
        use of that data by the reseller is then governed by their privacy policy. 
      </p>
      <h3>Accuracy &amp; Access </h3>
      <p>HP strives to keep your personally identifiable information accurate. 
        We make every effort to provide you with online access to your registration 
        data so that you may update or correct your information at the HP site 
        where it was submitted.<i><font color="#0000ff"> </font></i>To protect 
        your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify 
        your identity before granting you access or enabling you to make corrections. 
      </p>
      <h3>Security</h3>
      <p>HP is committed to ensuring the security of your information. To prevent 
        unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate 
        use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, 
        and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect 
        online. We use encryption when collecting or transferring sensitive data 
        such as credit card information. </p>
      <h3>Oversight</h3>
      <p>If you have comments or questions about our privacy policy, please send 
        them to this email address:<b><i><font color="#ff00ff"> </font></i></b><a href="mailto:privacy@hp.com"><i>privacy@hp.com</i></a><i><font color="#0000ff">.</font>
