<h1>TM Design for System4 4.5</h1>

<p>Working draft: February 7th, 2003</p>


<h2>1 TM Restructuring</h2>

<p>To keep the number of records in the TM manageable and improve the
leverage performance, TM will be restructured in 4.5.</p>

<p>The major change is to separate TM data and Job data. The current
TM data as of version 4.4.x represent both TM and job data. Job data
have a lot of duplicates from repetitive re-imports. A lot of
duplicates in a TM table hamper the leverage performance. The
separation of TM and job data allows TM data not having
duplicates.</p>

<p class="NOTE">In this document, "duplicate data" means two pairs of
source and target segments where source segments are identical each
other and target segments are also identical each other. When source
segments are identical but target segments are different each other,
we call it "multiple translation".</p>

<h3>1.1 Job Data</h3>

<p>In 4.5 release, the current translation_unit_variant and
translation_unit continue to serve as job data without any
modification. However, indexing on them and changing state to COMPLETE
at the job completion won't be necessary any more.
</p>

<p class="ISSUE">[Issue: If we want to leverage segments dynamically
from current, on-going jobs or do a concordance search these data, we
must index current page data.]</p>

<p class="ISSUE">[Issue: TIMESTAMP in translation_unit_variant must be
changed only when the segment text is changed to use it for
determining the latest modified segment.]</p>


<h3>1.2 TM Data</h3>

<p>There are two kinds of TM data. One is Segment TM and the other is
Page TM. Segment TM is used to leverage files that are imported into
the system for the first time (fresh import). Page TM is used to
leverage files that have been imported into the system previously
(re-import).</p>

<p>Segment data in both TM are populated at the job completion. TM
data are independent. They don't refer to job data and also they are
not referred to by any other data including leverage_match (a table
that stores leverage results). That way, TM data can be modified and
deleted as needed without any side effect.</p>

<h4>1.2.1 Segment TM</h4>

<p>Segment TM is a collection of segment data that have been brought
into the system. Segment TM is logically separated in one or more
Project TMs. Each Project TM cannot have duplicate segment data in it, but
it is allowed to store identical segments in different Project TMs.
</p>

<p>Segment TM has two different kinds of data, translatable and
localizable. To leverage imported data, translatable data are queried
using their indexes and localizable data are queried using their exact
match keys. When translatables and localizables are searched through
concordance search, their indexes are used so a partial text string
can be used to search for segments. For this reason, both
translatables and localizables are indexed.</p>

<!--  too detailed I'm afraid
<p>All TM data are encoded in Unicode. To ensure the same characters
are represented as the same Unicode scalar values thus the text can be
leveraged correctly, we normalize segment text in one of Unicode
normalization form. We choose Normalization Form C (NFC). The
technical details of NFC is in Unicode Standard Annex #15, <a
href=http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr15/>"Unicode Normalization
Forms"</a>. For the rational behind the choice of NFC, see <a
href=http://www.w3.org/TR/charmod/#sec-ChoiceNFC>"Character Model for
the World Wide Web 1.0"</a> from W3C.</p>
-->

<p>Segment data are not whitespace normalized in the TM. Whitespace
differences are absorbed in indexing and leveraging. The TM preserves
the original segment forms.</p>

<p>A unit of segment data is consisted of one source segment and
corresponding one or more target segments. There isn't any limitation
of number of target locales that can be associated with a source
locale segment.  If there are two different translations for a given
source segment in a given target locale, the two target segments in
the same target locale are associated with the source segment. There
also isn't any limitation of number of differently translated segments
in the same locale that can be associated with a source segment. For
example, one en_US source segment can be associated with one fr_FR
segment, one de_DE segment and three ja_JP segments. In this case,
Japanese has three different translations for an en_US source
segment.</p>

<p>When a job is completed, job data are added to segment TM.  The
data are merged into existing segment TM data in such a way as not to
create duplicate data in a Project TM. When adding a unit of data (one
source and some corresponding targets), a new entry is created in the
TM if an identical source segment doesn't exist yet. If an identical
source segment exists, corresponding target segments are examined and
if an identical target segment exists, nothing will be
added. Otherwise the target segments are added to the existing
unit. That may be a new target locale entry or an addition of a
different translation to existing target segments. The equality of
segments are measured by exact match key and type of segments. Even
the exact match key is the same but the type is different, they are
considered as different segments. By doing this, we can perform
segment type aware leveraging and filter the query with type on
concordance search.
</p>

<p>A segment is indexed when it is added to the TM. Not only source
but also target segments are indexed so target segments can be queried
in concordance search and multilingual leveraging can be achieved.</p>


<h4>1.2.2 Page TM</h4>

<p>Page TM segments are the latest completed job data. They are used
to leverage re-imported pages.</p>

<p>Page TM data are logically separated by page. A page is identified
by a combination of page external id and source locale. That is, if
the same page is imported twice using different source languages (in
reality it doesn't likely happen), they are considered as different
pages. Re-imported pages are leveraged using exact match keys.</p>

<p>Page TM segments are populated when a job is completed. When the
segments are populated, the old target locale segments for the page,
if exist, are discarded.  The segments are populated in such a way
that the duplicate segments in a page are consolidated into one
segment. This ensures that no any duplicates are returned from the
database when leveraging segments.</p>

<p class="NOTE">[Note: There is redundancy in segment data in Segment
TM and Page TM. Both segment data are populated when a job is
completed. That is, the same segments are stored in both Segment TM and
Page TM. This redundancy makes the leveraging process simpler and
probably faster.]</p>

<p>As with the case in Segment TM, if the type of the segment is
different, they are considered as different segments even if the texts
are exactly the same.</p>

<p>Although only exact match keys are used for leveraging Page TM
data, Page TM segments are indexed nonetheless. Indexes are used for
concordance search.</p>


<h4>1.2.3 Indexing</h4>

<p>When segments are added to Segment and Page TM, they are
indexed. Before indexed, segment text will be whitespace
normalized. In whitespace normalized text, there is no leading or
trailing whitespace and consecutive whitespaces are shrunk into one
SPACE (U+0020) character. Whitespace characters are all Unicode
characters that have White_space property in <a
href=ftp://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/PropList.txt>Extended
Character Properties</a> list. By normalizing whitespace, whitespace
insensitive matching can be achieved.</p>

<p>The main text and subflows in a segment will be indexed separately
so <a href=#MainTextOnlyLeveraging>Main Text Only Leveraging</a> can
be achieved. <font color=red>--- deferred to 4.6 or beyond</font></p>

<p>Both source and target segments must be indexed to enable <a
href=#MultilingualLeveraging>Multilingual Leveraging</a> and <a
href=#MultilingualConcordace>Multilingual Concordance Search</a>.</p>

<p>Indexing probably needs to use n-gram method. For some languages
such as Chinese or Japanese, the current word based indexing doesn't
perform well. That's because implementing a true word breaking for
these language is difficult and Java word breaker breaks "words" in
these language in very coarse granularity which makes leveraging and
concordance search nearly useless.</p>



<h2>2 Leveraging</h2>

<p class="NOTE">[Note: When a page is leveraged, the leverage result
shouldn't include references to TM data. Rather, it should keep the
copies of leveraged text. TM data can be modified or deleted at any
moment.]</p>

<h3>2.1 Performance Improvement</h3>

<p>Our recent study shows that the most prominent cause of the poor
performance of the leveraging is an excess number of candidate matches
returned from the database. In some cases, a page with a couple
hundreds of segments gets over one million segments of candidate
matches. Most of them are obviously duplicates.</p>

<p>By eliminating duplicate segments from both Segment and Page TM,
the problem will go away. To improve the performance further, only
unique segments in a page is sent to the leverager. In some pages,
there are many identical segments. For example, a hundred of spacer
gif images are used in some pages, which produces a hundred of
identical segments. By leveraging only one segment out of a hundred of
the same segments, we can reduce a great deal of time for querying
database and post processing. Again, identical segments means that
they have the same text and the same type.</p>


<h3>2.2 Leverage Type</h3>

<p>From user's perspective, we currently have only exact or fuzzy
match. A user can only assume that 99% fuzzy can be multiple
translation or whitespace difference. We need more leverage types to
show them what the leveraging result exactly is.</p>

<dl>
<dt>100% exact match</dt>
<dd>Byte-by-byte exactly the same. This is the match from Segment TM.</dd>
<br/>

<dt>Page TM exact match</dt>
<dd>Byte-by-byte exactly the same. This is the match from Page TM.</dd>
<br/>

<dt>Multiple translations</dt>
<dd>More than one translations are detected for a single source segment.</dd>
<br/>

<dt>Type difference</dt> <dd>Only types of segments are
different. Examples of types include url-a, css-border, text, etc. A
user option can turn this into 100% exact match. See <a
href=#TypeDifference>Type Insensitive Leveraging</a>.</dd> <br/>

<dt>Whitespace difference</dt> <dd>Only whitespaces are different. A
user option can turn this into 100% exact match. See <a
href=#WhiteSpace>White Space Insensitive Leveraging</a>.</dd> <br/>

<dt>Code difference</dt>
<dd>Only formatting codes such as &lt;b> in HTML are different. Code
difference includes:

  <ul>
  <li>Missing code</li>
  <li>Added code</li>
  <li>Location difference</li>
  <li>Code order difference</li>
  <li>Code content difference</li>
  <li>Any combination of the above</li>
  </ul>
<br/>

Some cases such as location difference can be turned into
100% exact match by a user option. See <a href=#CodeDifference>Code
Insensitive Leveraging</a>.
</dd>
<br/>

<dt>Fuzzy match</dt>
<dd>Text are different (real fuzzy).</dd>
</dl>

<p>Leverage result should carry these leveraging categories as its
property and users should be able to see them in the editor.</p>

<p class="NOTE">[Note: Page TM leveraging has only Page TM exact match
or Multiple translations by its nature. All other categories are the
result of Segment TM leveraging.]</p>


<h3>2.3 User Options</h3>

<p>In this release, several user options for leveraging are
provided. They are defined by users in TM Profile which is associated
with L10n Profile. See <a href=#TMProfile>TM Profile</a>.</p>

<h4><a name=TypeDifference>2.3.1 Type Insensitive Leveraging</a></h4>

<p>If this option is selected, segments different only in their type
become 100% exact match.</p>

<p>If this option is not selected, the user can choose how many
percentage penalty is given to this match. If the user choose 3% as
penalty, the percentage of a match is 97%. With or without the
option turned on, the match state is TYPE_DIFFERENCE.</p>

<p>This option is applied to the leveraging from both Segment TM
(fresh import) and Page TM (re-import).</p>


<h4><a name=WhiteSpace>2.3.2 Whitespace Insensitive Leveraging</a></h4>

<p>If this option is selected, segments different only in whitespace
become 100% exact match. When matching segments, trailing and leading
whitespaces are ignored and the difference of the number of
consecutive whitespaces is ignored. But the existence of whitespaces
is not ignored.</p>

<p>For example, the following segment pairs are considered as 100%
exact match if this option is turned on (whitespaces in the examples
are represented as underscore '_' character).</p>

<ul>
<li>"Hello,_world."</li>
<li>"Hello,__world."</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>"Hello,_world."</li>
<li>"_Hello,_world._"</li>
</ul>

<p>But the following is NOT 100% exact match.</p>

<ul>
<li>"Hello,_world."</li>
<li>"Hello,world."</li>
</ul>

<p>If this option is not selected, the user can choose how many
percentage penalty is given to this match. If the user choose 3% as
penalty, the percentage of a match is 97%. With or without the
option turned on, the match state is WHITE_SPACE_DIFFERENCE.</p>

<p>This option is applied only to the leveraging from Segment TM
(fresh import).</p>

<h4><a name=CodeDifference>2.3.3 Code Insensitive Leveraging</a></h4>

<p>If this option is selected, some cases of formatting code
 difference can become 100% exact match. The followings are the code
 difference that can be 100% exact match.</p>

<ul>
<li>Location difference</li>
<li>Code order difference</li>
<li>Code content difference (but not subflow)</li>
<li>Any combination of the above</li>
</ul>

<p>To become 100% exact, corresponding tags in the original segment
and the matched segment must be exactly the same or can be
substituted. See more on <a href=TagSubstitution>Tag
Substitution</a>. Note that the tag substitution is always performed
regardless of this option.</p>

<p>The followings are examples of segment pairs that can be 100% exact
match if this option is turned on.</p>

<ul>
<li>All work and &lt;B>no play&lt;/B> make Jack a dull boy.</li>
<li>All work and no play make &lt;B>Jack&lt;/B> a dull boy.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>All work and &lt;B>no play&lt;/B> make &lt;I>Jack&lt;/I> a dull boy.</li>
<li>All work and &lt;I>no play&lt;/I> make &lt;B>Jack&lt;/B> a dull boy.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>All work and &lt;B>no play&lt;/B> make Jack a dull boy.</li>
<li>All work and &lt;STRONG>no play&lt;/STRONG> make Jack a dull boy.</li>
</ul>

<p>But the followings are not 100% exact match even if this option is
turned on (missing tag, tag type is different).</p>

<ul>
<li>All work and &lt;B>no play&lt;/B> make Jack a dull boy.</li>
<li>All work and no play make Jack a dull boy.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>All work and &lt;B>no play&lt;/B> make Jack a dull boy.</li>
<li>All work and &lt;I>no play&lt;/I> make Jack a dull boy.</li>
</ul>


<p>Users can choose how many percentage penalty is given to this
match. The penalty is subtracted from 100% if matches can not become
100% (in the case of missing tags, etc) or this option is turned
off. If the user choose 3% as penalty, the percentage of a match is
97%. With or without the option turned on, the match state is
CODE_DIFFERENCE.</p>

<p>This option is applied only to the leveraging from Segment TM
(fresh import).</p>


<h4><a name=MultipleExactMatches>2.3.4 Multiple exact matches</a></h4>

<p>Multiple exact matches are more than one exact matches in which
the source texts are the same but the translations are
different. Users can choose the leveraging behavior from the following
options to handle multiple exact matches.</p>

<dl>
<dt>pick the latest</dt>
<dd>pick the most recently edited segment and make it 100% exact match. All the other matches are demoted.</dd>
<br/>

<dt>pick the oldest</dt>
<dd>pick the least recently edited segment and make it 100% exact match. All the other matches are demoted.</dd>
<br/>

<dt>demote</dt>
<dd>all matches are demoted.</dd>
</dl>


<p>Users can choose how many percentage penalty is given to demoted
matches. If the user choose 3% as penalty, the percentage of a demoted
match is 97%. With or without the option turned on, the match state is
MULTIPLE_TRANSLATION.</p>

<p>This option is applied only to the leveraging from Segment TM
(fresh import).</p>

<h4><a name=LatestMatch>2.3.5 Latest match for re-import</a></h4>

<p>If this option is selected, Page TM is not used for leveraging
re-import. Instead, the leverager tries to find the most recently
edited matches in Segment TM (remember everything in Page TM are
already in Segment TM).</p>

<p>This option is applied only to the leveraging for re-import.</p>


<h4><a name=MultilingualLeveraging>2.3.6 Multilingual leveraging</a></h4>

<p>Regular leveraging leverages from a language marked as source
to languages marked as target in the TM. Multilingual
leveraging allows to leverage from any language to any language that
are in the TM, even from target to source or from target to
target. For example, when there are English source and French and
German target TM data, Multilingual Leveraging allows to leverage from
French source to German target. Since this leveraging is somewhat less
reliable than the regular leveraging, this feature must be explicitly
turned on by user.</p>

<p>This option is applied only to the leveraging from Segment TM
(fresh import).</p>


<h3><a name=TagSubstitution>2.4 Tag Substitution</a></h3>

<p>When formatting codes are different in the original and matched
segment, tags in the matched segment are substituted for tags in the
original segment as much as possible.  The following two TMX marked-up
segments are considered as exactly the same (100% exact match) because
of the tag substitution if <a href=#CodeDifference>Code Insensitive
Leveraging</a> is turned on.
</p>

<ul>
<li>&lt;bpt type="bold">{\b &lt;/bpt>Special&lt;ept>}&lt;/ept> text</li>
<li>&lt;bpt type="bold">&amp;lt;B>&lt;/bpt>Special&lt;ept>&amp;lt;/B>&lt;/ept> text</li>
</ul>

<p>The first segment is RTF and the second one is HTML. Since both
segments have the same "bold" type codes, tags in the matched segment
can be replaced with the ones in the original segment. This example
is taken from <a
href=http://www.lisa.org/tmx/tmx.htm#ContentMarkup_Overview>"TMX
specification"</a>.</p>

<p>This feature is also useful when matching between the same format
segments. If the user changed only codes in the original document and
re-import it, he might expect all segments get 100% exact match. For
example, the following segments can be 100% exact match if <a
href=#CodeDifference>Code Insensitive Leveraging</a> is turned on.</p>

<ul>
<li>&lt;bpt type="span">&amp;lt;SPAN class=TEXT1>&lt;/bpt>text&lt;ept>&amp;lt;/SPAN>&lt;/ept></li>
<li>&lt;bpt type="span">&amp;lt;SPAN class=TEXT2>&lt;/bpt>text&lt;ept>&amp;lt;/SPAN>&lt;/ept></li>
</ul>

<p>When a tag is substituted for another,</p>

<ul>
<li>their type must be the same.</li>
<li>the number of subflows in the tags must be the same.</li>
<li>the type of each corresponding subflow must be the same.</li>
<li>subflow contents are not substituted.</li>
</ul>

<p>Tags that cannot be substituted are removed from the matched
segment.</p>


<!--  for 4.6 or above
<h4><a name=MainTextOnlyLeveraging>3.2.3 Main text only leveraging</a></h4>

<p>This is a request from PSO. <a
href=#DifferentFormatLeveraging>Different Format Leveraging</a> can
ignore the code difference, but not subflow text difference. When only
a subflow text is changed or an extra subflow is added, it would be
useful for some users to see the main text as exact and subflows as
fuzzy or no match in the editor. Since subflows are part of a segment,
the segment doesn't get 100% exact match, but with some special kind
of leveraging status, we may be able to show only the main text as
exact. From user's point of view, both main text and subflow look
independent segments after all.</p>

<p>Obviously, we need more research and careful thought on this.</p>
