NOTE:

* The behaviour of the word counter on Japanese text is strange.  
Need to confirm with a native speaker.

* Chinese and possibly Korean word counting are broken in the JDK 1.3.

* Suggest we use the iCU4J Rule based breakiterator.

* In general I trust the word counter on latin based languages only!
