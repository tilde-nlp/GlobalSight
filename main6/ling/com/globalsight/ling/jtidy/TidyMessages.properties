badaccess_frames=Pages designed using frames presents problems for people who are either blind or using a browser that doesn't support frames. A frames-based page should alwayy ainclude an alternative layout inside a NOFRAMES element.
badaccess_missing_image_alt=The alt attribute should be used to give a short description of an image; longer descriptions should be given with the longdesc attribute which takes a URL linked to the description. These measures are needed for people using non-graphical browsers.
badaccess_missing_image_map=Use client-side image maps in preference to server-side image maps as the latter are inaccessible to people using non- graphical browsers. In addition, client-side maps are easier to set up and provide immediate feedback to users.
badaccess_missing_link_alt=For hypertext links defined using a client-side image map, you need to use the alt attribute to provide a textual description of the link for people using non-graphical browsers.
badaccess_missing_summary=The table summary attribute should be used to describe the table structure. It is very helpful for people using non-visual browsers. The scope and headers attributes for table cells are useful for specifying which headers apply to each table cell, enabling non-visual browsers to provide a meaningful context for each cell.
badaccess_summary=For further advice on how to make your pages accessible see "{0}". You may also want to try "http://www.cast.org/bobby/" which is a free Web-based service for checking URLs for accessibility.
badchars_summary=Characters codes for the Microsoft Windows fonts in the range 128 - 159 may not be recognized on other platforms. You are instead recommended to use named entities, e.g. &trade; rather than Windows character code 153 (0x2122 in Unicode). Note that as of June 2005 most browsers support the new entities.
badform_summary=You may need to move one or both of the <form> and </form> tags. HTML elements should be properly nested and form elements are no exception. For instance you should not place the <form> in one table cell and the </form> in another. If the <form> is placed before a table, the </form> cannot be placed inside the table! Note that one form can't be nested inside another!
badlayout_using_body=You are recommended to use CSS to specify page and link colors
badlayout_using_font=You are recommended to use CSS to specify the font and properties such as its size and color. This will reduce the size of HTML files and make them easier to maintain compared with using <FONT> elements.
badlayout_using_layer=The Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) Positioning mechanism is recommended in preference to the proprietary <LAYER> element due to limited vendor support for LAYER.
badlayout_using_nobr=You are recommended to use CSS to control line wrapping. Use "white-space: nowrap" to inhibit wrapping in place of inserting <NOBR>...</NOBR> into the markup.
badlayout_using_spacer=You are recommended to use CSS for controlling white space (e.g. for indentation, margins and line spacing). The proprietary <SPACER> element has limited vendor support.

invalid_char={0,choice,0#replacing|1#discarding} invalid character code {1}
invalid_ncr={0,choice,0#replacing|1#discarding} invalid numeric character reference {1}
invalid_sgml_chars_summary=Character codes 128 to 159 (U+0080 to U+009F) are not allowed in HTML; even if they were, they would likely be unprintable control characters. Tidy assumed you wanted to refer to a character with the same byte value in the {0,choice,0#specified|1#Windows-1252|2#MacRoman} encoding and replaced that reference with the Unicode equivalent.
invalid_utf16={0,choice,0#replacing|1#discarding} invalid UTF-16 surrogate pair (char. code {1})
invalid_utf16_summary=Character codes for UTF-16 must be in the range: U+0000 to U+10FFFF. The definition of UTF-16 in Annex C of ISO/IEC 10646-1:2000 does not allow the mapping of unpaired surrogates. For more information please refer to http://www.unicode.org/unicode and http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/unicode.html
invalid_utf8={0,choice,0#replacing|1#discarding} invalid UTF-8 bytes (char. code {1})
invalid_utf8_summary=Character codes for UTF-8 must be in the range: U+0000 to U+10FFFF. The definition of UTF-8 in Annex D of ISO/IEC 10646-1:2000 also allows for the use of five- and six-byte sequences to encode characters that are outside the range of the Unicode character set; those five- and six-byte sequences are illegal for the use of UTF-8 as a transformation of Unicode characters. ISO/IEC 10646 does not allow mapping of unpaired surrogates, nor U+FFFE and U+FFFF (but it does allow other noncharacters). For more information please refer to http://www.unicode.org/unicode and http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/unicode.html.
invaliduri_summary=URIs must be properly escaped, they must not contain unescaped characters below U+0021 including the space character and not above U+007E. Tidy escapes the URI for you as recommended by HTML 4.01 section B.2.1 and XML 1.0 section 4.2.2. Some user agents use another algorithm to escape such URIs and some server-sided scripts depend on that. If you want to depend on that, you must escape the URI by your own. For more information please refer to http://www.w3.org/International/O-URL-and-ident.html.
