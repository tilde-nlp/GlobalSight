Problems:

- no inline comments (ADDED for entities, elements, ...) (partially fixed)
- no conditional sections (not with parsed entities as switch) (FIXED)

  <!ENTITY % HTML.Reserved "IGNORE">
  <![ %HTML.Reserved; [
  <!ENTITY % reserved "...."> ]]>

- SYSTEM ids must be URLs (must call parser with file: url) (FIXED)

	<!ENTITY % HTMLlat1 PUBLIC "-//W3C//ENTITIES Latin1//EN//HTML"
	   "HTMLlat1.ent"> <--------------- must be URL
	%HTMLlat1;

==========================================================================

- no multi-element decls: <!ELEMENT (a|b) (stuff)>
- no optionality in element decls: <!ELEMENT a - - (stuff)>
- no allowed/disallowed specs in element decls: <!ELEMENT a (s) +(stuff) -(stuff)>

- PUBLIC entities must have a system id
	<!ENTITY % ISOnum PUBLIC "ISO..." "path or url to file required" >
