# Automatic File Import Mapping File
# The format is as follows:
# <directory> | <jobNamePrefix> | <FileProfileName>
# 
# NOTE: Directories must be relative to the CXE docs directory.
#
# For example (on Windows 2000 or Windows NT)
# en_US\pressReleases | PressReleases | HtmlFrDe_HP
#
# For example (on Solaris)
# en_US/pressReleases | PressReleases | HtmlFrDe_HP

# NOTE: Make sure the slash "/" or "\" that is used in the
# directory paths is correct for the operating system.
# However if this is TeamSite AutoImport, always use "/"
