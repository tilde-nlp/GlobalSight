This readme instructs you how to make packages on linux.

0. Make sure buildAndRun.sh, run.sh and buildDesktopIcon.sh have permission to be executed.

1. Open run.sh and update the version.
2. If the ant has been installed, just run buildAndRun.sh. Otherwise, get the latest version of the DesktopIcon.zip and put it in current directory, and run run.sh.

3. After all above steps are done successfully, two installation packages will be generated in current directory named desktopicon_version.deb and DesktopIcon-version.i386.rpm.
