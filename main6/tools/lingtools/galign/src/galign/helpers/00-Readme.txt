Here go helper classes:

- classes that read persistent data like Alignment Package (GAP) files
- classes that manage application options (system-wide and user-specific)
- thread pools
- various stuff that has proven helpful in GlobalSight like
  EditUtil, ObjectPool, XmlParser, UTC date/time formatting etc.

UI-related utility classes: 
- some that help out with Swing idiosynchracies
- some that map application data (TMX, GAP, GAM etc) to UI data
  that can be displayed in UI components (models)
