White space normalize tuv table.

Whitespace normalization is performed only on HTML segments with a
specified locale (typically source locale). The procedure is as
follows.

  1. Take a string from either segment_string or segment_clob column.
  2. Whitespace normalize it using c.g.l.common.Text#normalizeWhiteSpaces().
  3. If the result of the normalized string is different from the
     original, it is written back to the database. exact_match_key is
     also recalculated and updated.
  4. If the segment is translatable, delete its indices from
     fuzzy_index table and reindex it.


How to Use:
1. unzip the archive.
2. go to <weblogic home> and type "setenv.cmd".
3. go to system4_normalization and type System4Normalization.bat plus
   parameters. The commandline syntax is as follows.

Usage: System4Normalization [-q] LOCALE
  LOCALE,  locale of which segments get normalized. This is usually
           source locale.
  -q,      Suppress the confirmation message.

For example, 

	System4Normalization.bat en_US

normalize white space and reindex the segments of en_US locale.
